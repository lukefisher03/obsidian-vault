This vault is dedicated to curating things that are interesting that I want to save or want to learn more about. There will be a lot of different categories and areas of interest to explore.

What path am I looking to go down? There are many options:

- **Hardware design**
- **Embedded Systems**
- Full Stack (likely to be less long term sustainable)
- FPGA Design
- **ASICs (Application specific integrated circuit)**
- Systems engineering
- Firmware Engineer
- Offensive Cyber
- Teaching


*HACKER NEWS IS COOL* - Good resources for niche blogs and possibly more reputable information.

## Coming up with projects?

The biggest hinderance to my progress I believe is my inability to find and come up with solid projects to work on and be passionate about. I need to balance building new things (*That I can actually complete*) and researching / gathering ideas with actual work.

Sources of inspiration for programming projects?

- Math, Cellular Automata, Stats
- CS and CE concepts I'm learning from school
- General IoT stuff for embedded and ESP32
- Useful real life utilities and life improvement stuff

The best way to become proficient is curiosity and a wealth of projects to continue gathering resources.
